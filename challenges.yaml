    text1: "The last module was not so interesting. That's because you can't really do anything cool in any programming language without using variables. A variable is a way of sorting data in programs."
    text2: "Think of a variable like a box with a label on it. Let's say your box has a label that says \"Box A\". Then you put a whole bunch of socks in the box. If someone asks you for some socks, you can just say \"Oh, you'll wnat to look in Box A\" But if, one day, you decide to remove all the socks and store some shoes in that box instead, you would still refer to that box as \"Box A\". The contents may have changed, but the label or the way of referring to the box remains the same."
    subheading1: "Assigning values to a variable"
    text3: "In most programming languages, to assign a value to a variable, we use the equals (=) operator. Python follows this standard, so in Python, assigning a message to our variable looks like this:"
    codeblock1:
      code: "user_text = \"Billy was here\"\nprint(user_text)"
    text4: "At any time later in the program, you can change the value of <i>user_text</i> varaible again like so:"
    codeblock2:
      code: "user_text = \"Billy was here\"\nprint(user_text)\nuser_text = \"Have you seen Billy lately?\"\nprint(user_text)"

    subheading2: "Naming Variables"
    text6: "You can name a variable almost anything you want, but there are a few guidelines youshould follow to prevent errors, and to make your program easier for humans to read andunderstand. After all, programming languages are for people, not for computers, so weshould always be thinking about the people trying to understand our code when we create variables."
    list1:
      item1: "Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores."
      item2: "You can start a variable name with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. So variable_1 and _variable1 are both ok, but 1_variable won't work."
      item3: "Variable names are case sensitive: string and String are two different variables to a computer."
      item4: "You shouldn't use Python's built-in keywords or functions as variable names, such as print or break."
      item5: "Keep your variable names short but descriptive. A variable called this_is_a_really_long_and_pointlessly_verbose_variable_name is probably a bit long in most contexts, but likewise a variable called a doesn't tell us much about what the variable's purpose is. Something short but also descriptive like username is much better"
